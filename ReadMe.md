## Fractal Simulation 

This is my personal challenge which inspired by "Times Tables, Mandelbrot and the Heart of Mathematics" by Mathloger tutorial. I watched his tutorials multiple times and tried to understand. 

I challenge myself by using JavaScript on HTML-5 Canvas. There are a lot challenging to 
understand the basic geometry and applying its knowledge on real life which is hard. 

During my development, I need to go back and watch the tutorial again and again to verify my code. 

Project Estimate Duration:

### How to Run Project: 
<ol>
<li>Open the file called "FractalSimulation.html" on your favorite browser (such as FireFox, Chorome or Edge)</li>

<br />

<li>
To make a custom drawing, enter the info as follow: 
<ol>
    <li>Number of Dots around Circumference: 200</li>
    <li>Multiplier: 200</li>
    <li>Click "Draw" button</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>
Or, to automate drawing: 
<ol>
    <li>Number of Dots around Circumference: 200</li>
    <li>Multiplier: 200</li>
    <li>Speed in Milliseconds: 250</li>
    <li>Click "Automate Draw" button</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>
Or
<ol>
    <li>Just Click "Automate Draw" button which will set all the require values for you.</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>
Click "Stop Timer" button to stop the timer. Then you can redraw it again.
</li>

</ol>
